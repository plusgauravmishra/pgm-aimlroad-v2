# AI ML ROADMAP V2

## Step 1: Study One Project that Looks Like Your Endgame

Once you have that project, do take some time to run through the documentation, the structure of the codebase, and the code. You will likely be lost. Especially if you don't know much about how to code. But this is a positive feeling when learning something new! Take some notes about repeated patterns that you are seeing, interesting bits that you understand, or topics you don't really understand. Bookmark this project and go back to it when you have moved along your learning path.

## Step 2: Learn the Programming Language

[This comprehensive course](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/scientific-computing-with-python) will guide you through the fundamentals of scientific computing, including data structures, and algorithms.

## Step 3: Learn the Libraries from Top to Bottom

[This free course](https://course.fast.ai/) is designed for people (and bunnies!) with some coding experience who want to learn how to apply deep learning and machine learning to practical problems.

## Step 4: Do One Project You're Passionate About in Max One Month

- _YET TO CHOOSE_  
The idea here is to struggle enough on a small-ish project to understand where your major knowledge gaps are and to experience what an actual machine learning developer experiences. By going free-form without the harness of a course or a book you will be able to do the actual parts of an ML project that are hard:
    - Plan, scope, and track your ML project's progress
    - Read documentation online about libraries
    - Read StackOverflow, GitHub threads, a random engineer's blog post and cryptic help forum about that one bug ðŸ‘º.
    - Build your project in a sub-optimal way and improve it over time.
    - Debug overfitting, underfitting, and generalization issues.

To pick a project that interests you, I suggest doing these three small exercises:
1. Think deeply about what interests you currently
2. Look at a list of project ideas
3. Take a look at open datasets

INSPOS PROJECT - [500-AI-Machine-learning-Deep-learning-Computer-vision-NLP-..](https://github.com/ashishpatel26/500-AI-Machine-learning-Deep-learning-Computer-vision-NLP-Projects-with-code)

MUST HAVE DATA REGARDING PROJECT - [Google Dataset Search](https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/)

## Step 5: Identify One Gap in Your Knowledge and Learn About it

To improve your learning process, create a list of gaps and rank them in order of priority. This conscious decision is valuable as it helps you identify the most important knowledge. Eliminate everything but the first item from the list, as this will help you identify more critical knowledge. After completing the first item, give yourself a day to a week to deepen your understanding of the topic. This will ensure you are functional for the next learning round.

## Step 6: Repeat Steps 0 to 5

Your first pass through this pipeline will likely be so-so at best. But you will have learned much more in a very short period of time than anything you would have achieved with the bottom-up approach. The value you will get out of this method increases quite rapidly through each pass of the pipeline. Each round will be easier and you will get a clearer picture of the field.
